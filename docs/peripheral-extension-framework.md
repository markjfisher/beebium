# Peripheral Extension Framework

## Overview

The BBC Micro supported diverse third-party peripherals connected via external ports (1 MHz bus, User Port, Analogue Port, RS-423, Tube). Beebium's peripheral extension framework provides a principled architecture for adding these peripherals as pluggable modules -- either compiled into the server executable (built-in) or loaded from shared libraries at startup (plugins).

Two properties of BBC Micro peripherals drive the framework design:

**Multi-port devices.** A single peripheral can connect to multiple interfaces simultaneously. The Voltmace Delta 14B/1 joystick interface connects to both the User Port and the Analogue Port. The framework models this with composition: one extension implementing multiple device callback interfaces.

**Sub-bus topologies.** Some peripherals introduce new buses. An Acorn SCSI Host Adapter plugs into the 1 MHz bus and provides a SCSI bus to which hard drives and LaserDisc players connect. An IEEE-488 adapter provides a GPIB bus. The framework supports this through dynamic extension points: an extension can declare that it provides a new named attachment site for other extensions.

For the SCSI use case that motivated this framework, see [Hard Disc Emulation Comparison](hard-disc-comparison.md).

## Architecture

### Extension Points

Extension points are named attachment sites where extensions can register. Built-in extension points are provided by the machine hardware; dynamic extension points are created by extensions during initialisation.

| Extension Point | Type | Provider |
|----------------|------|----------|
| `1mhz-bus` | Built-in | Machine hardware (FRED/JIM region, 0xFC00-0xFDFF) |
| `user-port` | Built-in | User VIA Port B (future) |
| `analogue-port` | Built-in | ADC (future) |
| `scsi` | Dynamic | Created by SCSI Host Adapter extension (future) |

Which built-in extension points are available depends on the machine variant. A Model A has none (no User VIA, no 1 MHz bus). A Model B has `1mhz-bus`, `user-port`, `analogue-port`, etc. The hardware policy class registers the extension points corresponding to its physical ports.

### Extensions

Each extension is a C++ class that inherits from `PeripheralExtension` and optionally implements device callback interfaces for the ports it uses. Extensions declare their dependencies (`attaches_to`) and what new extension points they create (`provides`).

```cpp
// src/core/include/beebium/extension/PeripheralExtension.hpp

class PeripheralExtension {
public:
    virtual ~PeripheralExtension() = default;

    // Manifest is the single source of truth for metadata.
    void set_manifest(ExtensionManifest manifest);
    const ExtensionManifest& manifest() const;
    virtual std::string_view name() const;         // default reads from manifest
    std::string_view description() const;          // reads from manifest

    // Dependencies and provisions
    virtual std::span<const std::string_view> attaches_to() const = 0;
    virtual std::span<const std::string_view> provides() const = 0;

    // Lifecycle
    virtual void init(ExtensionContext& ctx) = 0;
    virtual void shutdown() = 0;

    // gRPC services (zero or more)
    virtual std::vector<grpc::Service*> grpc_services() { return {}; }
};
```

### Port Handles and Device Callbacks

I/O methods are not on `PeripheralExtension`. Each extension point type defines a **port handle** (owned by the machine) and a **device callback interface** (implemented by the extension). This composition-based design avoids diamond inheritance for multi-port devices.

Currently implemented:

```cpp
// src/core/include/beebium/extension/OneMHzBusPort.hpp

class OneMHzBusPort {
public:
    uint8_t read(uint16_t offset);                    // MemoryMappedDevice interface
    void write(uint16_t offset, uint8_t value);       // MemoryMappedDevice interface
    void claim_addresses(uint16_t base, uint16_t end, // register device for address range
                         OneMHzBusDevice& device);
    void tick();                                       // tick all registered devices
    bool is_claimed(uint16_t offset) const;
};

// src/core/include/beebium/extension/OneMHzBusDevice.hpp

struct OneMHzBusDevice {
    virtual ~OneMHzBusDevice() = default;
    virtual uint8_t read(uint16_t offset) = 0;        // offset relative to 0xFC00
    virtual void write(uint16_t offset, uint8_t value) = 0;
    virtual void tick() {}
};
```

The `offset` parameter in `OneMHzBusDevice` is relative to 0xFC00 (the start of the FRED page), matching what the MemoryMap's Region binding computes. FRED occupies offsets 0x0000-0x00FF; JIM occupies 0x0100-0x01FF. Unclaimed addresses return 0xFF on read (74LS245 transceiver behaviour).

Future port types (UserPort, AnaloguePort) will follow the same pattern: a port handle class and a device callback interface, added without changing existing code.

### Dependency Resolution

The `ExtensionRegistry` collects extensions and resolves their dependency graph via topological sort (Kahn's algorithm) at startup:

1. Built-in extension points (registered by the hardware policy) are always satisfied
2. Extensions whose `attaches_to` dependencies are all satisfied are initialised first
3. After initialisation, any extension points they `provide` become available
4. This repeats until all extensions are initialised, or a cycle/unsatisfied dependency is detected

Extensions are shut down in reverse initialisation order.

### gRPC Services

Extensions can provide gRPC services by returning them from `grpc_services()`. These are collected after `init()` and registered with the gRPC `ServerBuilder` before the server starts.

A core `PeripheralExtensionService` (always present) lets frontends discover loaded extensions via a `ListExtensions` RPC.

### Extension Manifest

Each extension has a `manifest.json` file alongside its shared library. The manifest is the **single source of truth** for extension metadata, CLI syntax, and parameter schema:

```json
{
    "name": "scsi-hard-disc",
    "description": "SCSI hard disc target (DAT+DSC image)",
    "library": "scsi-hard-disc",
    "cli": "scsi-hdd",
    "attaches_to": ["scsi"],
    "parameters": [
        {"key": "scsi-id", "type": "integer", "position": 0, "default": "0",
         "description": "SCSI target ID (0-7)"},
        {"key": "image", "type": "filepath", "position": 1,
         "description": "Path to DAT disc image file"},
        {"key": "adapter-id", "type": "string", "keyword_only": true,
         "description": "ID of SCSI adapter to attach to"}
    ]
}
```

Fields:
- `name` -- canonical extension type name (used in presets, gRPC, dependency resolution)
- `cli` -- short CLI flag name (e.g. `--scsi-hdd`); defaults to `name` if omitted
- `library` -- shared library filename stem (platform adds `.dylib`/`.so`/`.dll`)
- `attaches_to` -- the attachment point(s) this extension plugs into (e.g.
  `["serial-port"]`); a *list*, because one extension may attach to several
  points at once (e.g. an adapter spanning the analogue port and the user port).
  Must match the extension's own `attaches_to()` (a build-time test enforces it).
- `provides` -- new extension points this extension creates for others to attach
  to (e.g. the SCSI adapter's `["scsi"]`); omit if none.
- `parameters` -- schema for CLI/preset/gRPC configuration (see below)

Listing `attaches_to` in the manifest (not only in code) lets tools enumerate
"what can plug in here" without loading any plugin -- the basis of the
attachment-point discovery below.

Parameter schema fields:
- `key` -- parameter name
- `type` -- `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, or `filepath`
- `position` -- positional index (0, 1, ...); omit or -1 for keyword-only
- `required` -- whether the parameter must be provided (default: false)
- `default` -- default value if not provided
- `description` -- human-readable description (used in error messages and gRPC)

Two framework-managed parameters are injected automatically and do not appear in the manifest:
- `id` -- instance identity (auto-generated UUID, overridable via `id=<value>`)
- `label` -- display name for GUIs (falls back to `id` if not set)

### Instance Identity

Every extension instance has an `id` (stable identity for referencing, logging, gRPC) and an optional `label` (display name for GUIs). If not provided by the user, `id` is auto-generated as a UUID and `label` falls back to `id`.

Extension-specific identifiers use qualified names to avoid collision with `id`: e.g. `scsi-id` for the SCSI target number, `adapter-id` to reference a parent adapter.

### CLI Syntax

Each extension becomes a first-class `--<cli-name>` flag. Arguments are colon-separated with positional and keyword support:

```bash
beebium-model-b-plus start \
    --acorn-scsi \
    --scsi-hdd 0:/path/to/drive0.dat \
    --scsi-hdd 1:/path/to/drive1.dat
```

Plugin extensions are auto-loaded from `<exe-dir>/extensions` (the canonical install layout populated by `beebium_finalize_plugin`). `--extension-dir <path>` adds further search directories — see [Extension Search Paths](#extension-search-paths) below.

Positional arguments may also be written in keyword form (must be in the correct positional slot):

```bash
--scsi-hdd scsi-id=0:image=/path/to/drive.dat
```

Keyword-only arguments (for advanced options):

```bash
--acorn-scsi id=scsi-a
--scsi-hdd 0:/path/to/drive.dat:adapter-id=scsi-a:id=boot-disc:label=System Disc
```

Filepaths are always the last positional element so shell tab-completion works. A value that contains a colon — a URI like `file://`/`http://`, or a `host:port` — must be wrapped in double quotes, since the argument form splits on `:` (e.g. `image="file:///discs/drive.dat"`). An unquoted `scheme://…` is detected and rejected with a message pointing to quoting.

Multiple instances of the same extension are created via repeated flags. Each invocation creates a separate instance with its own config and auto-generated id.

### Preset File Integration

Presets can include an `extensions` array:

```json
{
    "name": "Model B+ with SCSI hard disc",
    "model": "model-b-plus",
    "extensions": [
        {"name": "acorn-scsi"},
        {"name": "scsi-hard-disc", "config": {"scsi-id": "0", "image": "scsi0.dat"}},
        {"name": "scsi-hard-disc", "config": {"scsi-id": "1", "image": "scsi1.dat"}}
    ]
}
```

Extensions from presets are applied as baseline configuration; CLI flags can add more.

### gRPC Discovery

The `PeripheralExtensionService.ListExtensions` RPC returns loaded extensions with their full configuration:

```protobuf
message ExtensionInfo {
    string name = 1;                        // extension type
    string id = 2;                          // instance identity
    string label = 3;                       // display name
    repeated string attaches_to = 4;
    repeated string provides = 5;
    map<string, string> config = 6;         // current configuration
    repeated ParameterSchemaInfo parameters = 7;  // from manifest
    string description = 8;
}
```

GUI frontends can call `ListExtensions()` to discover loaded extensions, inspect their configuration, and present available parameters for editing.

### Built-in vs Plugin

The guiding principle follows the real hardware's internal/external boundary:

- **Internal hardware** (factory-fitted): built into the server executable
- **External hardware** (user-attached): loaded from a plugin

The same source code compiles to both a static library (for built-in use) and a shared library (for plugin use). No BBC Micro model (except the Master AIV, not yet emulated) had a built-in SCSI adapter — it was an external card. The SCSI adapter and hard disc target are plugins, loaded via `--acorn-scsi` / `--scsi-hdd`.

### Extension Search Paths

Beebium resolves available extensions from multiple sources in priority order. For each `--<cli-name>` the highest-priority source wins, so a user-supplied directory can replace a stock built-in or augment the default install.

| Priority | Source | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (lowest) | Built-in extensions compiled into the server | Always |
| 2 | `<exe-dir>/extensions` (auto-detected) | If the directory exists |
| 3..N | Each `--extension-dir <path>` in CLI order | Always processed; later overrides earlier |

Notes:

- `--extension-dir` is repeatable. Each occurrence appends to the search list.
- The auto-detected `<exe-dir>/extensions` is included whether or not `--extension-dir` is given. It's the canonical install layout produced by `beebium_finalize_plugin` (see `cmake/BeebiumPlugin.cmake`).
- A user-supplied `--extension-dir` whose path does not exist is a hard error (`Extension directory does not exist: <path>`, exit code `EX_CONFIG = 78`). The auto-detected default keeps failing silently — it's reasonable for that path not to exist on a stripped-down install.
- An extension manifest with the same `cli` field as one in a lower-priority source replaces it. If the replacement has a non-empty `library` field, the plugin loader is used (so a user dir can swap in a forked dynamic build of a stock extension).

### Discovering Available Extensions

These commands surface the same resolved extension set without launching the emulator. All honour `--format pretty|tsv|jsonl`:

```bash
# Concise list of every available extension (cli flag + description)
beebium-model-b list-extensions

# Add user dirs to the search path; same priority rules as `start`
beebium-model-b list-extensions --extension-dir ~/my-beebium-plugins

# Full parameter schema for one extension; <name> matches CLI stem or canonical name
beebium-model-b describe-extension acorn-rtc
beebium-model-b describe-extension acorn-65c02-coprocessor

# `start --help` includes the same list in its "Extensions:" section
beebium-model-b start --help
```

`start --help` shows the section using the auto-default search paths only; it does not pre-scan user `--extension-dir` paths (kept side-effect-free). For a view that includes user paths, use `list-extensions --extension-dir ...`.

### Attachment Points

An **attachment point** is a place an extension can plug in: the serial port, the user port, the 1 MHz bus, the Tube, a SCSI bus. The catalogue gives each a display name and an *occupancy* range `[min..max]` -- how many extensions must and may attach. A connector is `0..1` (optional, at most one); a bus is `0..N` (unbounded). The range, rather than a single/multi flag, accommodates hardware in between -- e.g. a future machine with two Tube sockets is `0..2`. A configuration UI uses this to ask, for each point, *"which one, if any, of these extensions would you like to load?"*.

```bash
# The catalogue: id, display name, occupancy, description
beebium-model-b list-attachment-points

# Only the extensions that attach to a given point
beebium-model-b list-extensions --attaches-to serial-port
```

Because `attaches_to` lives in the manifest, both queries work **before any emulator is launched** -- the graphical clients run these CLI commands (parsing `--format jsonl`) the same way they run `create-preset`, since there is no server to talk to over gRPC at configuration time. (The gRPC `PeripheralExtensionService.ListExtensions` is a different view: the extensions *loaded* in a *running* server.)

The point ids are the same strings used by `attaches_to()` / `provides()` / `register_extension_point()`; their display names live in `AttachmentPointCatalogue.hpp`, which is the single place to add a new point (e.g. a future `analogue-port`).

## Developer Guide: Creating a Built-in Extension

This walkthrough uses TestScratchRam (8 bytes of RAM at 0xFC50-0xFC57) as the reference implementation.

### 1. Create the Extension Directory

```
src/extensions/my-extension/
    CMakeLists.txt
    MyExtension.hpp
    MyExtension.cpp
    my_extension.proto         (if providing gRPC services)
    MyExtensionService.hpp     (if providing gRPC services)
    manifest.json              (for plugin builds)
    plugin_entry.cpp           (for plugin builds)
```

Add the subdirectory to `src/extensions/CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(my-extension)
```

### 2. Define the Extension Class

The extension inherits from `PeripheralExtension` and the device callback interface for each port it uses:

```cpp
// MyExtension.hpp
#include <beebium/extension/ExtensionContext.hpp>
#include <beebium/extension/OneMHzBusDevice.hpp>
#include <beebium/extension/OneMHzBusPort.hpp>
#include <beebium/extension/PeripheralExtension.hpp>

namespace beebium {

class MyExtension : public PeripheralExtension,
                    public OneMHzBusDevice {
public:
    MyExtension();
    ~MyExtension() override;

    static std::unique_ptr<MyExtension> create();

    std::span<const std::string_view> attaches_to() const override {
        static constexpr std::string_view deps[] = {"1mhz-bus"};
        return deps;
    }

    std::span<const std::string_view> provides() const override { return {}; }

    void init(ExtensionContext& ctx) override;
    void shutdown() override;

    // OneMHzBusDevice
    uint8_t read(uint16_t offset) override;
    void write(uint16_t offset, uint8_t value) override;
};

}  // namespace beebium
```

**Key points:**
- `name()` is inherited from `PeripheralExtension` and reads from the manifest -- do not override it
- `attaches_to()` declares which extension points are needed
- `provides()` declares which new extension points this extension creates (empty for leaf extensions)
- The constructor and destructor must be out-of-line if the class has `unique_ptr` members with incomplete types (pimpl for gRPC service)

### 3. Implement the Extension

```cpp
// MyExtension.cpp
#include "MyExtension.hpp"

namespace beebium {

MyExtension::MyExtension() = default;
MyExtension::~MyExtension() = default;

std::unique_ptr<MyExtension> MyExtension::create() {
    auto ext = std::unique_ptr<MyExtension>(new MyExtension());
    ext->set_manifest(ExtensionManifest{
        "my-extension",
        "Description of my extension",
        "my-extension",
        {}  // empty path for built-in
    });
    return ext;
}

void MyExtension::init(ExtensionContext& ctx) {
    ctx.get<OneMHzBusPort>().claim_addresses(0x60, 0x63, *this);
    // Create gRPC service here if needed
}

void MyExtension::shutdown() {
    // Clean up gRPC service here if needed
}

uint8_t MyExtension::read(uint16_t offset) {
    // Handle read at offset (relative to 0xFC00)
    return 0xFF;
}

void MyExtension::write(uint16_t offset, uint8_t value) {
    // Handle write at offset (relative to 0xFC00)
}

}  // namespace beebium
```

**Key points:**
- Use `create()` factory method to set the manifest programmatically
- In `init()`, claim addresses on the bus port via `ExtensionContext`
- Addresses are offsets relative to 0xFC00, not absolute 16-bit addresses
- `claim_addresses()` throws if the range overlaps with another device

### 4. Add a gRPC Service (Optional)

Define a proto file:

```protobuf
// my_extension.proto
syntax = "proto3";
package beebium;

service MyExtensionService {
    rpc GetStatus(GetMyStatusRequest) returns (GetMyStatusResponse);
}
```

Implement the service:

```cpp
// MyExtensionService.hpp
#include "my_extension.grpc.pb.h"
#include <grpcpp/grpcpp.h>

namespace beebium {

class MyExtensionServiceImpl final : public MyExtensionService::Service {
public:
    explicit MyExtensionServiceImpl(MyExtension& ext) : ext_(ext) {}
    // ... implement RPC methods ...
private:
    MyExtension& ext_;
};

}  // namespace beebium
```

Override `grpc_services()` in the extension to return the service:

```cpp
std::vector<grpc::Service*> MyExtension::grpc_services() {
    if (service_) return {service_.get()};
    return {};
}
```

### 5. Build Configuration

```cmake
# src/extensions/my-extension/CMakeLists.txt

# Compile proto (if providing gRPC services)
beebium_compile_proto(
    TARGET beebium_ext_my_extension
    PROTO_FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/my_extension.proto
    PROTO_PATH ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
)

# Static library (built-in)
add_library(beebium_ext_my_extension STATIC
    MyExtension.cpp
    ${beebium_ext_my_extension_PROTO_SRCS}
    ${beebium_ext_my_extension_GRPC_SRCS}
)

target_include_directories(beebium_ext_my_extension PUBLIC
    ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
    ${beebium_ext_my_extension_OUT_DIR}
)

target_link_libraries(beebium_ext_my_extension PUBLIC
    beebium_core gRPC::grpc++ protobuf::libprotobuf
)
```

### 6. Register as Built-in

In `src/server/include/beebium/server/ServerMain.hpp`, include the header and register the extension alongside other built-ins:

```cpp
#include "MyExtension.hpp"

// In StartSubcommand::invoke(), after registry setup:
extension_registry.register_extension(beebium::MyExtension::create());
```

Link the server executables against `beebium_ext_my_extension` in `src/server/CMakeLists.txt`.

## Developer Guide: Creating a Plugin Extension

A plugin extension uses the same source code as a built-in but adds a shared library target and a plugin entry point.

### 1. Add Plugin Entry Point

```cpp
// plugin_entry.cpp
#include "MyExtension.hpp"
#include <beebium/extension/ExtensionManifest.hpp>

extern "C" {

__attribute__((visibility("default")))
beebium::PeripheralExtension* beebium_create_extension(
        const beebium::ExtensionManifest& manifest) {
    auto* ext = new beebium::MyExtension();
    ext->set_manifest(manifest);
    return ext;
}

}
```

**Key points:**
- The entry point is `extern "C"` for `dlsym` lookup
- It receives the manifest (parsed from `manifest.json` by the `PluginLoader`)
- It returns a raw pointer -- the framework takes ownership via `std::unique_ptr`
- Use `__attribute__((visibility("default")))` to ensure the symbol is exported

### 2. Add Manifest

```json
{
    "name": "my-extension",
    "description": "Description of my extension",
    "library": "my-extension"
}
```

The `library` field is the filename stem; the platform adds `.dylib`, `.so`, or `.dll`.

### 3. Add Shared Library Target

```cmake
# Append to src/extensions/my-extension/CMakeLists.txt

if(BEEBIUM_BUILD_SERVICE)
    add_library(beebium_plugin_my_extension SHARED
        MyExtension.cpp
        plugin_entry.cpp
        ${beebium_ext_my_extension_PROTO_SRCS}
        ${beebium_ext_my_extension_GRPC_SRCS}
    )

    target_include_directories(beebium_plugin_my_extension PRIVATE
        ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}
        ${beebium_ext_my_extension_OUT_DIR}
    )

    target_link_libraries(beebium_plugin_my_extension PRIVATE
        beebium_core gRPC::grpc++ protobuf::libprotobuf
    )

    set_target_properties(beebium_plugin_my_extension PROPERTIES
        PREFIX "" OUTPUT_NAME "my-extension"
    )

    add_custom_command(TARGET beebium_plugin_my_extension POST_BUILD
        COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
            ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/manifest.json
            $<TARGET_FILE_DIR:beebium_plugin_my_extension>/manifest.json
    )
endif()
```

### 4. Load at Runtime

```bash
beebium-model-b start --extension-dir /path/to/plugins --extension my-extension
```

The `PluginLoader` reads `manifest.json` from subdirectories of `--extension-dir`, then loads only the extensions named by `--extension`. Extensions not named are never loaded.

## Startup Sequence

```
1.  Server starts
2.  First-pass argument parsing: extract --extension-dir and --preset
3.  If --preset specified, load preset (including extensions section)
4.  Scan extension manifests from --extension-dir (no code loaded)
5.  Build CLI name lookup table from manifest cli fields
6.  Second-pass argument parsing: recognise --<cli-name> flags,
    parse colon-separated arguments against manifest parameter schemas
7.  Hardware policy class registers built-in extension points
    (e.g. "1mhz-bus" for Model B; nothing for Model A)
8.  Built-in extensions registered with auto-generated ids
9.  Plugin extensions loaded for each CLI/preset extension instance:
    - dlopen shared library, call beebium_create_extension(manifest)
    - set_config() with parsed config map (including auto-generated id)
10. Dependency graph built from attaches_to / provides declarations
11. Topological sort determines init order (error on cycles)
12. Extensions initialised in dependency order:
    - init() receives ExtensionContext with port handles and provider lookup
    - After init, providers registered in context for downstream extensions
13. grpc::Service* instances collected from all initialised extensions
14. PeripheralExtensionService created (core discovery service)
15. ServerBuilder registers all built-in + extension + discovery services
16. BuildAndStart() -- gRPC server begins accepting connections
17. Emulation begins
```
