"""B+ 128K *SRLOAD repro for the bug seen in the running app.

User report: ``*SRLOAD R.ADFS 8000 W Q`` on the B+ 128K does not
produce a SlotHeaderChangedEvent, and pressing Break afterwards
prints "Bad sum" and hangs the MOS. The hang suggests the bytes
landing in SRAM W (slot 12) don't match the source ROM, so the
MOS's sideways-ROM scan rejects it.

This test does the equivalent end-to-end on the emulator and checks
the bytes byte-for-byte against the source ANFS image. The
SlotHeaderChangedEvent and the live header fields in GetSlotStatus
are checked too so we can tell whether it's a load-time corruption,
a scanner gap, or both.
