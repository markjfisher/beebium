\ serial_break.asm
\
\ A tiny BBC Micro program that drives or detects a serial BREAK at the
\ hardware level (MC6850 ACIA + Serial ULA / SERPROC), assembled by beebasm
\ and run from an auto-booting DFS disc image. It is the BBC-application end
\ of an application-to-application break test against a host peer (pySerial /
\ a recording serial device).
\
\ Assemble with exactly one mode selected:
\   beebasm -i serial_break.asm -D MODE=0 -do tx.ssd -boot PROG   ; transmit
\   beebasm -i serial_break.asm -D MODE=1 -do rx.ssd -boot PROG   ; detect
\
\ The program owns the serial hardware by writing the chip registers directly
\ rather than going through the MOS RS423 driver. That is deliberate: it keeps
\ the test deterministic (no interrupt-driven MOS buffering racing the poll)
\ and shows the bare-metal sequence. The MOS-level equivalents are noted in
\ comments.

ACIA_CONTROL = &FE08    \ write: 6850 control register; read: status register
ACIA_DATA    = &FE09    \ write: TDR; read: RDR
SERPROC      = &FE10    \ Serial ULA latch (SERPROC), write-only

\ Zero-page locations the C++ test harness peeks (the &70-&8F block is reserved
\ for the user, so the MOS will not touch them).
READY    = &71          \ set once RS423 is selected (carrier up) and we are polling
SENTINEL = &70          \ set when the program has finished its job

\ 6850 control-register values (8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop, divide-by-16):
\   bits 0-1 = 01  divide-by-16 clock
\   bits 2-4 = 101 word select 8N1
\   bits 5-6 = transmitter control, bit 7 = receive interrupt enable
CTRL_RESET = &03        \ master reset the ACIA (counter-divide = 11)
CTRL_8N1   = &15        \ 8N1, /16, RX IRQ off, /RTS low, no break (TX control = 00)
CTRL_BREAK = &75        \ as CTRL_8N1 but TX control = 11 -> hold TX in BREAK
                        \ (the MOS-level equivalent is OSBYTE &9C / *FX156,96,159)

\ Serial ULA latch: bit 6 selects RS423 (which drives the ACIA /DCD low, i.e.
\ carrier present); the low bits pick the transmit/receive baud (index 0 = 19200).
