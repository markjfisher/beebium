"""Hardware indicator (LED, motor activity) state access for the
Beebium client.

Indicators are named observable signals (``caps-lock-led``,
``shift-lock-led``, ``floppy-0-activity-led``, etc.) with values in
the range 0..255. Some indicators are PWM/duty-cycle filtered on the
server, so intermediate values can appear during fast transitions --
helpers like :meth:`Indicators.is_definitive_on` make those transients
explicit at the call site.
