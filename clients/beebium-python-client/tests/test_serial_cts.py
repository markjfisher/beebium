"""End-to-end /CTS back-pressure test driven by real BBC BASIC.

Unlike test_serial_extensions (which pokes the ACIA registers directly), this
exercises the full MOS serial driver: BASIC directs output to the RS423 port
(*FX3,1) and transmits a payload larger than the device's TX buffer. With the
rpc-serial client refusing to drain, the device's buffer fills, the Serial ULA
asserts the ACIA's /CTS, and the MOS serial OSWRCH path blocks -- the *guest*
stalls while the *host* stays responsive. Draining on the client releases /CTS
and the guest runs to completion.

Synchronisation is by feedback, not by fixed delays: each step runs the machine
until a polled condition holds (the BASIC prompt, the device buffer filling, a
completion sentinel), advancing emulated time so the result is independent of
host/CI wall-clock speed. The TX buffer is shrunk via tx_buffer so /CTS engages
after a handful of bytes.
