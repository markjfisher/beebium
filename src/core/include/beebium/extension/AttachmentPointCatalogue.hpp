// An attachment point is a place a peripheral extension can plug in: the RS423
// serial port, the user port, the 1MHz bus, the Tube, a SCSI bus, etc. Each
// extension declares the point(s) it attaches to via attaches_to() (and, for
// listing without loading, in its manifest). This catalogue gives every point a
// human-readable display name plus its occupancy bounds, so a configuration UI
// can ask "which of these <point> extensions would you like?" and know whether
// that means at most one (a connector) or several (a bus).
//
// Occupancy is an integer range [min_occupancy, max_occupancy]: min is how many
// must be attached (usually 0 -- optional), max is how many may be (1 for a
// single connector, more for a bus). max_occupancy is std::nullopt when there is
// no fixed upper bound. The range models real hardware that does not fit a
// single/multi boolean -- e.g. a machine with two Tube sockets is 0..2.
//
// The point *ids* are the same strings used by attaches_to() / provides() and
// register_extension_point(). This is the single source of truth for their
// display names. It is deliberately open to extension: future points (e.g. an
// "analogue-port" for joysticks) just gain an entry here.
